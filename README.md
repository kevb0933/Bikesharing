The framework for this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:

Who uses bikeshare programs?
What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
How much are the bikes used and by whom?
