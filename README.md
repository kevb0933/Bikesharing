The objective was to analyze bikeshare data from the NYC CitiBike data for a presentation to those looking to start a bikeshare buisness program in Des Moines, Iowa. Though the location is different from NYC, this data and visualizations can help answer any questions they might have about opening this potentionally profitable buisness.

# Key Points Being Observed

+ Who uses bikeshare programs?
+ What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
+ How much are the bikes used and by whom?
+ What is the length of time of bikesharing?

# All can be seen in the visualizations provided within the Tableau story.
